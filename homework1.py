def mykmeans(pixels, K):
    """
    Your goal of this assignment is implementing your own K-means.
​
    Input:
        pixels: data set. Each row contains one data point. For image
        dataset, it contains 3 columns, each column corresponding to Red,
        Green, and Blue component.
​
        K: the number of desired clusters. Too high value of K may result in
        empty cluster error. Then, you need to reduce it.
​
    Output:
        class: the class assignment of each data point in pixels. The
        assignment should be 0, 1, 2, etc. For K = 5, for example, each cell
        of class should be either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The output should be a
        column vector with size(pixels, 1) elements.
​
        centroid: the location of K centroids in your result. With images,
        each centroid corresponds to the representative color of each
        cluster. The output should be a matrix with K rows and
        3 columns. The range of values should be [0, 255].
